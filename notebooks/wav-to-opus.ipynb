    "Inplace conversion of .wav files to .opus format and updating corresponding JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script performs the following tasks:\n",
    "1. Recursively searches for .wav files in the specified input directory and its subdirectories.\n",
    "2. Converts each .wav file to .opus format using the ffmpeg command-line tool.\n",
    "3. Updates the corresponding JSON file by replacing the .wav extension with .opus in the 'audio_path' field.\n",
    "4. Removes the original .wav file after successful conversion.\n",
    "5. Utilizes multithreading to process the files concurrently for improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion process uses the following ffmpeg settings:\n",
    "- Audio codec: libopus\n",
    "- Bitrate: 32K (defined in FFMPEG_BITRATE constant)\n",
    "- Application: voip (defined in FFMPEG_APPLICATION constant)\n",
    "- Frame duration: 40 (defined in FFMPEG_FRAME_DURATION constant)\n",
    "- Compression level: Randomly selected between 1 and 9 for each file\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants:\n",
    "- FFMPEG_BITRATE: The bitrate used for the ffmpeg conversion.\n",
    "- FFMPEG_APPLICATION: The application setting used for the ffmpeg conversion.\n",
    "- FFMPEG_FRAME_DURATION: The frame duration used for the ffmpeg conversion.\n",
    "- MAX_WORKER_THREADS: The maximum number of worker threads used for concurrent processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions:\n",
    "- compression_level(): Returns a random integer between 1 and 9 for the compression level.\n",
    "- convert_to_opus(input_path: Path): Converts a .wav file to .opus format using ffmpeg.\n",
    "- update_json(json_path: Path): Updates the 'audio_path' field in the corresponding JSON file.\n",
    "- process_file(wav_path: Path): Processes a single .wav file by converting it to .opus and updating the JSON file.\n",
    "- process_files(input_dir: Path): Processes all .wav files in the specified input directory and its subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "1. Set the `input_dir` variable to the desired input directory path.\n",
    "2. Run the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "- The script requires the ffmpeg command-line tool to be installed and accessible from the system's PATH.\n",
    "- The script assumes that each .wav file has a corresponding JSON file with the same name (except for the extension).\n",
    "- The script modifies the JSON files in-place and removes the original .wav files after successful conversion.\n",
    "- The script utilizes multithreading with a maximum number of worker threads defined by the MAX_WORKER_THREADS constant.\n",
    "- The estimated time left is calculated based on the average processing time per file and the number of files left.\n",
    "- Error handling is implemented for subprocess calls, JSON file loading/writing, and file I/O operations.\n",
    "- The `pathlib` module is used for file path handling and manipulation.\n",
