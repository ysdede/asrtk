# ASRTK: Automatic Speech Recognition Toolkit

ASRTK is a comprehensive Python toolkit for building and deploying end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.  
This project is a rewrite and open-source release of the previously closed-source toolkit known as "YTK".  
It provides a streamlined workflow and a collection of utilities to simplify the process of creating, training, and evaluating ASR models.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Easily prepare and preprocess speech datasets, including data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
- *Model Training: Train state-of-the-art ASR models using popular architectures and techniques. (Coming soon)*
- **Evaluation and Testing**: Evaluate the performance of trained models using various metrics and perform inference on new audio data.
- ~~Deployment: Deploy trained ASR models in real-world applications with support for different platforms and environments.~~

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher
- NumPy
- SciPy
- librosa
